## Setting Up for Success

### 🕐 Best Time to Review

#### **Option A: Morning Person**
🌅 **First thing after meds kick in**
- Usually 30-45 min after taking
- Coffee made, but not jittery
- Before the day gets chaotic

#### **Option B: Night Owl**  
🌙 **Evening wind-down**
- After dinner, before tiredness
- When house is quiet
- Part of Sunday night routine

#### **Option C: Lunch Break**
☀️ **Midday reset**
- Away from morning chaos
- Before afternoon crash
- Good for remote workers

**Pro tip:** Same time each week. Your ADHD brain loves predictable structure.

## During Your Review

### 😵 Zoning Out is OK!

**The timer will save you:**

| Time Left | Alert | What It Means |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| 50% | 🔔 | "Hey, halfway there!" |
| 20% | 🔔🔔 | "Time to wrap up this thought" |
| 10% | 🔔🔔🔔 | "Quick! Final thoughts!" |

**When you zone out:**
1. Timer beeps bring you back
2. Coach asks simple question
3. Just answer honestly
4. No shame, keep going

### 🔄 Quick Recovery Techniques

**Lost your train of thought?**

Coach: "What's been on your mind?"

You (honest options):
- "Sorry, zoned out, can you repeat?"
- "Um... work stuff and home stuff"
- "Everything feels overwhelming"
- "I don't know where to start"

**All valid responses!** Coach adapts.

## ADHD-Specific Strategies

### 🎯 The Mind Sweep Phase

**Your ADHD advantage:** Random associations are GOOD here!

```
Normal brain: "Work project, then related tasks..."
ADHD brain: "Work project, cat food, that song, 
             dentist, Amazon return, weird dream,
             call Mom, fix bike, learn Spanish..."
             
Both are perfect! Capture EVERYTHING.
```

**Tips:**
- Don't organize while dumping
- Weird thoughts are welcome
- Incomplete thoughts are fine
- Just keep typing

### 📋 The Project Review Phase

**Common ADHD struggles here:**

| Struggle | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| "Too many projects!" | Pick top 3 only |
| "Can't estimate progress" | Use "stuck/moving/done" |
| "Everything feels urgent" | Coach helps prioritize |
| "Perfectionism paralysis" | "Good enough" updates |

### ⭐ The Prioritization Phase

**The Rule of 3:**
```
❌ DON'T: List 10 "priorities"
✅ DO: Pick 3 and only 3

Why? ADHD brains can juggle 3 balls.
     10 balls = all balls dropped.
```

**How to choose:**
1. What has a real deadline?
2. What will cause problems if ignored?
3. What will feel amazing to complete?

## Dealing with Resistance

### 😤 "I Don't Want To Do This"

**That's your ADHD talking. Try:**

| Resistance | Reframe |
|------------|---------|
| "This is boring" | "30 minutes = organized week" |
| "I'll do it later" | "Timer starts NOW, ends in 30" |
| "It won't help" | "External brain backup helps" |
| "Too much effort" | "Coach does the thinking" |

### 🎮 Gamification Tricks

**Make it a game:**
- Beat last week's mind sweep count
- Try to finish each phase before final beep
- Reward yourself after (cookie, YouTube, etc.)
- Track streak of weekly reviews

---

## Common ADHD Moments

### 💭 "I Forgot What We're Doing"

**No problem!** Coach reminds you:
- Current phase shown always
- Next question provided
- No need to remember the process

### ⚡ "This Feels Too Fast/Slow"

**Remember:**
- Fast is good (prevents overthinking)
- Slow moments are just 2-3 minutes max
- Trust the timer over your time perception
- You can add details after if needed

### 🌀 "My Mind Is Spinning"

**Use the structure:**
1. Answer coach's specific question
2. Ignore other thoughts for now
3. They'll come up in mind sweep
4. One question at a time

---

## Building the Habit

### 📅 Week 1-4: Foundation

```
Week 1: Just show up (even if distracted)
Week 2: Try to stay focused 50% of time
Week 3: Notice it gets easier
Week 4: Feels more automatic
```

### 🏆 Success Metrics for ADHD

**You're succeeding if you:**
- ✅ Started the review (showing up = 80%)
- ✅ Made it through all phases
- ✅ Captured some thoughts
- ✅ Set any priorities

**You're NOT failing if you:**
- ❌ Zoned out multiple times
- ❌ Gave short answers
- ❌ Felt rushed
- ❌ Forgot some items

## Troubleshooting ADHD Challenges

### 🚨 Crisis Mode: "Everything Is On Fire!"

When overwhelmed:
1. Do review anyway (structure helps)
2. Mind sweep will be long (that's OK)  
3. Pick 3 fires to put out this week
4. Others will wait (they always do)

### 😴 Wrong Medication Timing

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too early (meds not working) | Reschedule 1 hour later |
| Too late (meds wearing off) | Try morning instead |
| Weekend (no meds) | Consider half dose for review |
| Forgot meds | Do review anyway, be patient |

### 🎪 Too Many Distractions

**Emergency simplification:**
- Bathroom first
- Phone in another room  
- Close everything except GTD Coach
- Tell others: "30 minutes, don't interrupt"
- Use noise-canceling headphones

## Celebrating ADHD Wins

### 🎉 What Success Looks Like

**Small wins that matter:**
- "I did review 3 weeks in a row!"
- "I captured that important thing I kept forgetting"
- "I only picked 3 priorities and stuck to it"
- "The timer helped me not hyperfocus"

### 💪 Your ADHD Superpowers in Review

- **Creativity**: Wild mind sweep connections
- **Hyperfocus**: When engaged, you're unstoppable
- **Pattern recognition**: Spot trends others miss
- **Crisis management**: Your normal is everyone's crisis

## Remember

### 🌟 Core Truths

1. **Your brain is not broken** - it just needs external structure
2. **The timer is your friend** - it's doing executive function for you
3. **Progress > Perfection** - showing up is most of the work
4. **Consistency builds habits** - even imperfect reviews help

### 💝 Be Kind to Yourself

ADHD makes everything harder. You're doing something hard. That makes you brave.

Every week you review, you're winning.
