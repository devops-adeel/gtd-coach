# Documentation Consolidation Summary

## Results
- **Before**: 7,131 lines across 30+ scattered files
- **After**: 2,018 lines with clear Diátaxis structure
- **Reduction**: 72% (5,113 lines removed)

## Key Improvements

### 1. Applied Diátaxis Framework
Created clear separation by user needs:
- `tutorial/` - Learning (getting started)
- `how-to/` - Tasks (setup, integrations, testing)
- `reference/` - Lookup (config, CLI, API)
- `explanation/` - Understanding (architecture, ADHD design)

### 2. Eliminated Duplication
- CLAUDE.md reduced from 553 to 33 lines
- Extracted integrations to dedicated guides
- Consolidated test documentation
- Single source of truth for each topic

### 3. Archived Historical Content
Moved to `archive/`:
- All phase documentation (Phase 3, 4, etc.)
- LangGraph migration docs
- Test results and reports
- Old implementation summaries

### 4. Created Missing Documentation
Added:
- CLI reference
- API reference
- Integration guides (Timing, Langfuse, Graphiti)
- ADHD design rationale
- Maintenance guidelines

### 5. Simplified Entry Points
- README.md: 54 lines with clear links
- CLAUDE.md: 33 lines for AI guidance only
- Clear navigation structure

## Ongoing Maintenance

Added `MAINTENANCE.md` with:
- Quarterly review process
- Documentation standards
- Link checking tools
- Target: Keep under 2,500 lines

## Files Modified/Created
- 7 new how-to/reference/explanation docs
- 12 files archived to development-history
- 3 old guides archived
- 2 files removed (redundant)

The documentation is now organized, concise, and maintainable with clear guidelines for future updates.
