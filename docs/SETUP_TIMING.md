# Timing App Setup - Ultra Simple Guide

## Philosophy: Manual is Better
The Timing API doesn't support project creation, which is actually perfect for our minimal approach. You'll create just 3 projects manually - more control, less complexity.

## One-Time Manual Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create 3 Projects in Timing App

1. Open Timing app
2. Click the **+** button in Projects sidebar
3. Create exactly these 3 projects:

| Project Name | Color | Productivity | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Deep Work - Week 34 (2025)** | ðŸŸ¢ Green | High (+1) | Your focused work |
| **Admin & Communication** | ðŸŸ  Orange | Neutral (0) | Email, Slack, meetings |
| **Reactive & Urgent** | ðŸ”´ Red | Low (-1) | Interruptions, firefighting |

### Step 2: Create Rules in Timing App

Open Timing app and create these 3 simple rules:

1. **Deep Work Rule**
   - âŒ¥-drag your coding apps (VS Code, Terminal, etc.) to "Deep Work - Week XX"
   - âŒ¥-drag documentation apps (Notion, Obsidian) to "Deep Work - Week XX"

2. **Admin Rule**
   - âŒ¥-drag email apps (Mail, Gmail) to "Admin & Communication"
   - âŒ¥-drag chat apps (Slack, Discord) to "Admin & Communication"
   - âŒ¥-drag calendar apps to "Admin & Communication"

3. **Reactive Rule**
   - âŒ¥-drag browser to "Reactive & Urgent" (for random browsing)
   - Everything else defaults here

### Step 3: Calendar Integration (Optional)

If you want to see calendar events in Timing:
1. Timing â†’ Preferences â†’ Calendar
2. Check the calendars you want to display
3. They'll show as vertical bars on your timeline

## That's It!

No complex setup. No time entry creation. No manual tracking.

Timing will automatically categorize your work into these 3 buckets.

During weekly review, you'll see reality:
- How much deep work you actually did
- How much time went to admin
- How much was reactive/urgent

## Weekly Maintenance

Every Monday, manually create a new "Deep Work - Week XX" project in Timing with the current week number. The Admin and Reactive projects stay the same and can be reused.
