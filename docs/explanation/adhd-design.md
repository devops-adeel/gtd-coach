# ADHD-Specific Design Decisions

## Understanding ADHD Challenges

GTD Coach addresses core ADHD executive function deficits:
- **Time blindness**: Cannot sense time passing
- **Task initiation**: Struggle to start without external pressure
- **Working memory**: Forget intentions quickly
- **Attention regulation**: Hyperfocus or scattered attention
- **Emotional dysregulation**: Overwhelm leads to shutdown

## Design Principles

### 1. External Executive Function
The coach acts as your frontal lobe:
- Tracks time so you don't have to
- Provides transitions between tasks
- Holds context across phases
- Celebrates completion

### 2. Strict Time Boxing
Why 30 minutes total?
- Long enough to be thorough
- Short enough to maintain focus
- Creates urgency that drives action
- Prevents hyperfocus rabbit holes

### 3. Progressive Audio Alerts
Why audio instead of visual?
- Breaks through hyperfocus
- Works when looking away
- Increasing urgency matches ADHD response curve
- Cannot be ignored like notifications

### 4. Five-Phase Structure
Each phase addresses specific ADHD needs:

**STARTUP (2 min)**
- Transition ritual from previous activity
- Load context from last session
- Build momentum with easy "yes"

**MIND SWEEP (10 min)**
- Dump racing thoughts quickly
- No judgment or organization required
- Split into capture (5 min) and process (5 min)

**PROJECT REVIEW (12 min)**
- 45 seconds per project maximum
- Forces "good enough" decisions
- Prevents analysis paralysis

**PRIORITIZATION (5 min)**
- Simple ABC system
- Maximum 3 items per category
- Clear next actions only

**WRAP-UP (3 min)**
- Immediate save (working memory support)
- Celebration (dopamine reward)
- Clean exit (closure)

## Coaching Tone Variations

### Firm Tone
For when you need structure:
- Direct commands
- Time reminders every response
- No flexibility on phases
- Military-style efficiency

### Gentle Tone
For when you need support:
- Encouraging language
- Flexibility acknowledgment
- Celebration of effort
- Self-compassion reminders

## Pattern Detection

The system tracks ADHD patterns:
- **Task switching frequency**: Indicates scattered attention
- **Response length**: Correlates with overwhelm
- **Time awareness**: Questions about time remaining
- **Completion rates**: Phases finished vs abandoned

## Intervention Strategies

### Rapid Task Switching
When detected: >3 topic changes in 30 seconds
- Intervention: "Let's capture that thought and return to [previous topic]"
- Rationale: Gentle redirection without shame

### Overwhelm Indicators
When detected: Long pauses, "I don't know", giving up language
- Intervention: "Just name one thing, even if small"
- Rationale: Reduces cognitive load to minimum

### Hyperfocus Risk
When detected: Single topic >50% of phase time
- Intervention: Timer alerts increase in frequency
- Rationale: External interruption required

## Memory Support

### At Startup
- Shows recurring patterns from previous weeks
- No action required - just recognition
- Helps with ADHD memory retrieval issues

### During Review
- All inputs saved immediately
- No need to remember between phases
- Coach maintains context

### After Review
- Complete transcript available
- Structured JSON for tools
- Weekly summaries for pattern recognition

## Why These Specific Times?

Research and iteration led to these durations:
- **2 min startup**: Minimum viable transition
- **10 min mind sweep**: Captures 80% before fatigue
- **12 min projects**: 15-16 projects @ 45 seconds
- **5 min priorities**: Forces quick decisions
- **3 min wrap-up**: Just enough for closure

## Accessibility Considerations

- **No mouse required**: Keyboard only
- **High contrast output**: Clear in terminal
- **Simple inputs**: Just text, no formatting
- **Predictable flow**: Same every time
- **Offline capable**: No internet distractions
