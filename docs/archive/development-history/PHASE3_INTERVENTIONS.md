# Phase 3: Just-in-Time Interventions Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Overview
Phase 3 implements Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) for real-time ADHD support during GTD reviews. The system detects rapid task switching patterns and offers grounding exercises to help users refocus, following evidence-based practices from mobile health intervention research.

## Architecture

### Minimal Connection Design
Instead of creating new infrastructure, Phase 3 connected existing components:

1. **GraphitiMemory** already had:
   - `_detect_rapid_switching()` - Pattern detection logic
   - `_trigger_gentle_intervention()` - Intervention delivery
   - `intervention_callback` - Callback mechanism (unused)

2. **GTDCoach** now provides:
   - `handle_intervention()` - Processes intervention requests
   - `deliver_grounding_exercise()` - 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique
   - Intervention metrics tracking in `review_data`

3. **N-of-1 Experimenter** enhanced with:
   - Week 7 experiment for intervention testing
   - ABAB design (off/on/off/on)
   - Override support via `EXPERIMENT_OVERRIDE_INTERVENTIONS`

## Implementation Details

### Intervention Detection
The system monitors for rapid context switching during the MIND_SWEEP phase:
- Tracks topic changes across consecutive inputs
- Triggers when 3+ switches occur within 30 seconds
- Uses existing pattern detection in `GraphitiMemory.add_interaction()`

### Intervention Delivery
When rapid switching is detected:
1. System offers intervention with simple prompt
2. User can accept (Enter) or skip (any key)
3. Acceptance triggers 30-second grounding exercise
4. All responses are tracked in metrics

### 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Exercise
Evidence-based technique for ADHD anxiety and focus:
- **5**: Name 5 things you can SEE
- **4**: Notice 4 things you can TOUCH
- **3**: Listen for 3 things you can HEAR
- **2**: Identify 2 things you can SMELL
- **1**: Notice 1 thing you can TASTE

Each step gets 5 seconds, total duration ~30 seconds.

### Intervention Controls
- **Cooldown**: 10 minutes between interventions
- **Max per session**: 2 interventions
- **Phase restriction**: Only during MIND_SWEEP
- **User control**: Always skippable

## Configuration

### N-of-1 Experiment (Week 7)
```yaml
- week: 7
  name: "Just-in-Time Interventions"
  variable: "jitai_enabled"
  conditions:
    - value: "off"  # Baseline
      config:
        interventions_enabled: false
    - value: "on"   # Treatment
      config:
        interventions_enabled: true
        intervention_type: "grounding"
        cooldown_minutes: 10
```

### Manual Override
```bash
# Force interventions on
export EXPERIMENT_OVERRIDE_INTERVENTIONS=on

# Force interventions off
export EXPERIMENT_OVERRIDE_INTERVENTIONS=off
```

## Metrics Tracked

### Engagement Metrics
- `interventions_offered`: Total interventions triggered
- `interventions_accepted`: User accepted grounding
- `interventions_skipped`: User skipped intervention

### Pattern Metrics
- Context switches before/after intervention
- Time to respond to intervention prompt
- Session completion with/without interventions

## Testing

### Test Script: `test_interventions.py`
Validates all components:
1. ✅ Callback connection verified
2. ✅ Rapid switching detection functional
3. ✅ Grounding exercise delivery working
4. ✅ Metrics properly tracked
5. ✅ N-of-1 integration complete

### Test Results
```
✅ Phase 3 intervention system is working!

Key achievements:
- Intervention callback connected to GraphitiMemory
- Rapid task switching detection functional
- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise implemented
- Metrics tracking in place
- N-of-1 experiment integration complete
```

## Research Foundation

### Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs)
- Deliver support at moment of need, not arbitrary boundaries
- Evidence from mobile health shows higher engagement
- Microrandomized trials (MRTs) optimize timing and content

### Why Grounding Works for ADHD
- Reduces anxiety from task overwhelm
- Engages sensory systems to refocus attention
- Simple enough to complete during high stress
- Evidence shows effectiveness for executive function

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. **gtd_coach/coach.py** (~100 lines)
   - Added intervention tracking to review_data
   - Connected callback to GraphitiMemory
   - Implemented handle_intervention() method
   - Added deliver_grounding_exercise() method

2. **gtd_coach/experiments/n_of_1.py** (~30 lines)
   - Added _apply_intervention_config() handler
   - Updated override mapping for interventions

3. **config/experiments/n_of_1_schedule.yaml** (~30 lines)
   - Added Week 7 intervention experiment
   - Added override environment variable

### Total Implementation: ~160 lines (vs 500+ in original plan)

## Success Metrics

### Target Outcomes
- Reduction in context switches: >20% after intervention
- User acceptance rate: >40% (learning phase)
- No increase in session dropout
- Positive correlation with task completion

### Measurement Plan
- Track via N-of-1 ABAB design over 4 sessions
- Compare on/off conditions for effectiveness
- Analyze pattern changes pre/post intervention
- Monitor long-term engagement trends

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 4 Opportunities
- Multiple intervention types (breathing, movement, etc.)
- Personalized trigger thresholds
- Predictive intervention timing
- Integration with biometric data

### Scaling Considerations
- Store intervention preferences in user profile
- Learn optimal timing per individual
- Expand to other phases beyond MIND_SWEEP
- Add intervention recommendation engine

## Conclusion

Phase 3 successfully implements evidence-based, just-in-time interventions by connecting existing infrastructure rather than building new systems. The implementation follows JITAI principles, uses proven grounding techniques, and integrates seamlessly with the N-of-1 experimentation framework for continuous optimization.

The minimal approach (160 lines vs 500+) demonstrates the value of understanding existing systems before adding complexity. By leveraging what was already built, Phase 3 delivers immediate value with minimal code changes and risk.
