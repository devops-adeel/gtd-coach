## Key Testing Patterns Implemented

### 1. **LangGraph-Specific Patterns**
```python
# Multi-turn conversation with interrupts
async def test_complete_weekly_review_conversation():
    with patch.object(workflow, 'interrupt', side_effect=interrupt_responses):
        state = workflow.startup_phase(state)
        state = workflow.mind_sweep_capture(state)
        # ... continues through all phases

# Command primitive testing
resume_command = Command(
    resume={"user_response": "input"},
    update={"additional_context": "extra"}
)
```

### 2. **Realistic User Scenarios**
```python
# 30-minute review with actual timing
phase_timings = {
    "STARTUP": 2,
    "MIND_SWEEP": 10,
    "PROJECT_REVIEW": 12,
    "PRIORITIZATION": 5,
    "WRAP_UP": 3
}
```

### 3. **Failure Handling**
```python
# Service outage with retries and fallback
async def attempt_save():
    try:
        await memory.add_episode(data)
    except ConnectionError:
        # Fall back to local JSON
        save_to_fallback(data)
```

## Recommendations

1. **Test Organization**: Consider adding pytest markers for better test selection:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.e2e
   @pytest.mark.slow
   @pytest.mark.critical_path
   ```

2. **Performance**: Some E2E tests are slow (30-min review). Consider:
   - Parallel execution in CI
   - Separate slow test suite
   - Mock timers for faster execution

3. **Maintenance**: Document test data requirements and mock setup for future maintainers
