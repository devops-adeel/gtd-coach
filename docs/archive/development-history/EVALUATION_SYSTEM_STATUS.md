# LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation System - Complete Status

## ✅ Phase 1 Implementation Complete

### System Overview
A sophisticated post-session evaluation system that assesses GTD Coach interactions using LLM-as-a-Judge pattern without impacting user experience.

## Components Implemented

### 1. **Evaluation Module** (`gtd_coach/evaluation/`)
- **post_session.py**: Fire-and-forget evaluator with cloud/local fallback
- **criteria.py**: ADHD-specific evaluation prompts
- **__init__.py**: Module entry point

### 2. **Configuration** (`config/evaluation/judge_config.yaml`)
- Batch size: 3 interactions (optimized for reliability)
- Timeout: 30 seconds (increased for cloud APIs)
- Models configured:
  - Task extraction: GPT-4o-mini
  - Memory relevance: GPT-4o-mini  
  - Coaching quality: GPT-4o
  - Local fallback: Llama 3.1 8B

### 3. **Integration Points**
- **gtd_coach/coach.py**: Tracks interactions and triggers evaluation
- **Langfuse**: Score tracking and observability
- **OpenAI API**: Cloud evaluation models
- **LM Studio**: Local fallback model

## Test Results

### ✅ Simple Evaluation Test
```
Task extraction score: 1.0
Coaching quality score: 0.8
Local model fallback: 0.8
```

### ✅ Langfuse Integration
```
- Scores successfully uploaded
- Trace IDs properly linked
- Alerts for below-threshold metrics working
```

## Configuration Status

### ✅ Dependencies Installed
- PyYAML: Installed locally with --break-system-packages
- langfuse[openai]==3.2.3: Installed and configured
- OpenAI API: Key configured from ~/.env

### ✅ Services Running
- LM Studio: Running with 3 models loaded
- Langfuse: Connected to http://langfuse-prod-langfuse-web-1.orb.local

## Evaluation Metrics

### Three Dimensions Assessed
1. **Task Extraction Accuracy** (Threshold: 0.7)
   - Validates all user-mentioned tasks are captured
   - Identifies incorrectly extracted items

2. **Memory Relevance** (Threshold: 0.5)
   - Assesses if retrieved memories are contextually relevant
   - Checks if memories are actually utilized in responses

3. **Coaching Quality** (Threshold: 0.6)
   - Evaluates ADHD-appropriate structure
   - Checks time awareness
   - Validates supportive tone
   - Assesses executive function support

## Cost Optimization Features

### Implemented Optimizations
- **Priority Phase Filtering**: Only evaluates MIND_SWEEP, PRIORITIZATION, PROJECT_REVIEW
- **Batch Processing**: Groups 3 interactions per batch
- **Smart Timeouts**: 30-second timeout with graceful degradation
- **Local Fallback**: Uses Llama 3.1 when cloud unavailable

### Estimated Costs
- Local model only: $0.00 per session
- With OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.015 per session
- With GPT-4o for quality: ~$0.025 per session

## Progressive Enhancement Path

### Current State: Phase 1 - Observation Mode ✅
- Post-session evaluation without user impact
- Fire-and-forget pattern
- Data collection for pattern learning

### Future Phases (Not Yet Implemented)
- **Phase 2**: Pattern learning from evaluation data
- **Phase 3**: Phase-boundary interventions
- **Phase 4**: Real-time adaptive behavior

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test simple evaluation
python3 test_simple_eval.py

# Test full evaluation system
python3 test_evaluation.py

# Test Langfuse scoring
python3 test_langfuse_scoring.py

# Check Langfuse API methods
python3 test_langfuse_api.py
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Evaluation Results
- Stored in: `~/gtd-coach/data/evaluations/eval_<session_id>.json`
- Contains: Scores, reasoning, errors, timeouts

### Langfuse Dashboard
- View at: http://langfuse-prod-langfuse-web-1.orb.local
- Tracks: Score trends, below-threshold alerts, session performance

## System Health

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Evaluation Module | ✅ Working | Successfully evaluating interactions |
| OpenAI Integration | ✅ Working | GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o configured |
| Local Fallback | ✅ Working | Llama 3.1 8B via LM Studio |
| Langfuse Scoring | ✅ Working | Scores uploading correctly |
| Configuration | ✅ Complete | All settings optimized |
| Error Handling | ✅ Robust | Graceful degradation on failures |

## Summary

The LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation system is fully operational in observation mode. It successfully:
- Evaluates coaching sessions without impacting user experience
- Uses a hybrid cloud/local model approach for reliability
- Tracks scores in Langfuse for observability
- Provides detailed reasoning for each evaluation
- Handles failures gracefully with fallback mechanisms

The system is ready for production use and will collect valuable data to improve coaching quality over time.
