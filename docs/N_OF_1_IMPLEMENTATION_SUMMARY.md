# N-of-1 Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All tests are passing (6/6) and the N-of-1 experimentation framework is fully operational.

## What We Built

### 1. **North Star Metrics Tracking** ✓
- **Memory Relevance Score**: Tracks how many retrieved memories are actually used (0-1 scale)
- **Time to First Capture**: Measures seconds from session start to first meaningful input
- **Task Follow-through Rate**: Compares planned vs completed tasks across sessions
- **ADHD Metrics**: Context switches/minute, hyperfocus/scatter periods, pre-capture hesitation

### 2. **N-of-1 Experiment Framework** ✓
- **ABAB Design Pattern**: Single-subject research methodology appropriate for N=1
- **6-Week Rotation**: Tests 6 key variables sequentially
- **User Override**: Environment variables for manual control
- **Automatic Config Application**: Applies experimental conditions to coach instance

### 3. **Experiment Schedule** ✓
Variables tested in order:
1. Memory Retrieval Strategy (recency vs frequency-based)
2. Temperature Profiles (fixed vs adaptive per phase)
3. Coaching Style (directive vs socratic)
4. Prompt Length (concise vs detailed)
5. Prompt Structure (bullet points vs narrative)
6. ADHD Language Patterns (time pressure vs encouragement)

### 4. **Analysis Tools** ✓
- **Within-Condition Variance**: Measures consistency in same experimental condition
- **Personal Effect Size**: Cohen's d adapted for single-subject design
- **Order Effects Detection**: Checks if AB differs from BA
- **Weekly Report Generator**: Comprehensive analysis with recommendations

### 5. **Enhanced Metadata Integration** ✓
All LLM calls now include:
- Experiment metadata (week, variable, condition, pattern position)
- North Star metrics in real-time
- ADHD behavioral patterns
- Session context and timing

## Fixed Issues

1. **Time to Insight Tracking**: Fixed timing precision issues in measurement
2. **Config Path Resolution**: Added multiple fallback paths for Docker/local environments
3. **Missing Import**: Added defaultdict import to weekly report generator
4. **Async/Sync Mismatch**: Removed unnecessary async from track_task_followthrough

## How to Use

### Running Experiments
```bash
# Run weekly review with current experiment
./scripts/docker-run.sh

# Override experiment variable (example)
export EXPERIMENT_OVERRIDE_STYLE=socratic
./scripts/docker-run.sh
```

### Viewing Results
```bash
# Generate weekly report
docker compose run --rm gtd-coach python3 scripts/weekly_experiment_report.py

# Analyze specific week
docker compose run --rm gtd-coach python3 scripts/weekly_experiment_report.py --week 2025-W33 --save
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run full test suite
docker compose run --rm gtd-coach python3 scripts/test_n_of_1_implementation.py

# Test individual components
docker compose run --rm gtd-coach python3 -m pytest tests/test_integrations.py::test_north_star_metrics
```

## Key Files

- **gtd_coach/metrics/north_star.py**: Core metrics tracking
- **gtd_coach/experiments/n_of_1.py**: Experiment framework
- **config/experiments/n_of_1_schedule.yaml**: 6-week schedule
- **scripts/analysis/analyze_n_of_1.py**: Statistical analysis
- **scripts/weekly_experiment_report.py**: Report generation

## Data Storage

All metrics are saved to:
- **JSON Files**: `~/gtd-coach/data/north_star_metrics_*.json`
- **Langfuse Traces**: Includes experiment metadata when configured
- **Graphiti Episodes**: Enhanced with North Star metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Start First Experiment**: The system will automatically begin with Week 1's Memory Retrieval Strategy experiment
2. **Collect Baseline**: Run 2-3 sessions to establish personal baseline
3. **Weekly Analysis**: Generate reports each week to track progress
4. **Iterate**: Use override capability to test promising configurations

## Success Criteria

Based on the configured thresholds:
- Memory Relevance: Target 0.8 (80% of shown memories used)
- Time to First Capture: Target 30 seconds
- Task Follow-through: Target 0.6 (60% completion rate)

## Monitoring

The system automatically tracks:
- All three North Star metrics per session
- ADHD-specific patterns (context switches, hyperfocus)
- Experiment adherence (ABAB pattern completion)
- Within-condition variance (consistency check)

## Architecture Benefits

- **Zero Additional Cognitive Load**: Experiments run automatically
- **Single-Subject Focus**: Designed specifically for N=1 use case
- **Personal Effect Sizes**: Statistics adapted for individual optimization
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Can override based on immediate needs

The implementation is production-ready and will begin collecting data with your next GTD review session.
