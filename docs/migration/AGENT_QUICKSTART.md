# GTD Coach Agent Implementation - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Current Status (January 22, 2025)

After testing, the agent implementations are **partially functional** but need configuration:

### ✅ What Works
- **Dependencies installed**: langchain-openai, langgraph, todoist-api-python
- **Workflows initialize**: Both clarify and review workflows can be loaded
- **Fallback works**: System automatically uses agent when legacy is unavailable
- **OpenAI configured**: API key is set and ready

### ⚠️ Known Issues
1. **Todoist API key not set**: Need to set `TODOIST_API_KEY` in environment
2. **FalkorDB optional**: Warning appears but doesn't block functionality
3. **Some tool errors**: Minor issues with tool calling patterns (being fixed)

## 📋 Quick Setup

### 1. Set Todoist API Key
```bash
# Add to your .env file:
echo "TODOIST_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env

# Or export temporarily:
export TODOIST_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 2. Test Agent Implementations

#### Clarify (Daily Inbox Processing)
```bash
# Check current status
python3 -m gtd_coach clarify --status

# Run clarify (now uses agent by default)
python3 -m gtd_coach clarify

# Force legacy mode (if still available)
python3 -m gtd_coach clarify --legacy
```

#### Weekly Review
```bash
# Run weekly review (uses agent by default)
python3 -m gtd_coach review

# Resume interrupted session
python3 -m gtd_coach review --resume
```

## 🔄 Migration Status

The system is currently in **transition mode**:
- Legacy implementations are being phased out
- Agent implementations are becoming the default
- Automatic fallback to agent when legacy is unavailable

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
python3 test_agent_ready.py
```

Expected output:
- ✅ LangChain OpenAI Import
- ✅ Clarify Workflow Init
- ✅ Review Workflow Init
- ✅ OpenAI API Key configured

## 📝 Key Differences from Legacy

### Clarify Command
**Legacy behavior**:
- Simple terminal prompts
- Direct Todoist API calls
- Synchronous execution

**Agent behavior**:
- LangGraph workflow with state management
- Tool-based architecture
- Interrupt/resume capability
- Better error recovery

### Review Command
**Legacy behavior**:
- Phase-based with timers
- Direct API integrations
- Linear flow

**Agent behavior**:
- Graph-based workflow
- Checkpointing for resume
- More flexible phase transitions
- Better context preservation

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Todoist not configured"
Set your `TODOIST_API_KEY` environment variable

### "FalkorDB driver not available"
This is optional - the system works without it

### "Tool call errors"
These are being fixed but don't usually block functionality

## 📊 Current Usage Pattern

During the transition period:
1. **Both implementations exist** but agent is preferred
2. **Legacy is deprecated** and may be removed soon
3. **Monitor your workflow** for any issues
4. **Report problems** to fix forward

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up Todoist API key** if not already done
2. **Try clarify command** with a few test tasks
3. **Monitor for errors** and document any issues
4. **Use daily** to build confidence

## 📈 Success Metrics

You'll know the agent implementation is working when:
- ✅ Commands complete without crashes
- ✅ Todoist tasks are processed correctly
- ✅ No data loss or corruption
- ✅ Performance is acceptable (< 30 seconds for clarify)

## 🔧 Roll-Forward Strategy

If you encounter issues:
1. **Document the error** in TRIAL_LOG.md
2. **Continue using** the command (it often recovers)
3. **Fix will be applied** without reverting
4. **No need to switch back** to legacy
