# Sequential Interrupt Handling Fix - Summary

## Problem
The GTD Coach agent was entering an infinite loop when handling multiple sequential interrupts (e.g., asking 3 questions in a row during startup phase).

## Root Cause Analysis (Verified with Langfuse)

### Initial Behavior
- `check_in_with_user_v2` loops through multiple questions, calling `interrupt()` for each
- When resumed with first answer, the node re-executes from the beginning (LangGraph behavior)
- First `interrupt()` returns cached value, second `interrupt()` triggers new interrupt
- The runner's while loop detected `__interrupt__` and created a NEW stream (line 406)
- This nested streaming caused re-execution from the beginning, creating infinite loop

### Langfuse Evidence
Session analysis showed:
- 4 interrupts detected but 0 resume commands initially tracked
- Questions being repeated multiple times
- Nested streaming operations within 1 second of each other

## Solution Implementation

### Code Change (runner.py lines 404-419)
**Before:**
```python
# Continue streaming with the user's response
last_result = None  # Reset before streaming
for chunk in self.agent.stream(
    Command(resume=user_input),
    config,
    stream_mode="values"
):
    self._handle_stream_chunk(chunk)
    last_result = chunk
```

**After:**
```python
# Resume using invoke to get complete state (avoids nested streaming)
logger.info("Using invoke() for resume to avoid nested streaming")
last_result = self.agent.invoke(
    Command(resume=user_input),
    config
)
# Handle the result as a single chunk
if last_result:
    self._handle_stream_chunk(last_result)
```

## Verification with Langfuse

### Test Results (Session 20250820_105135)
- ✅ 3 sequential interrupts properly handled
- ✅ 3 matching resume commands with correct values ('8', 'No blockers', "Yes, let's go")
- ✅ Each resume returns the next interrupt as expected
- ✅ No infinite loops or repeated questions
- ✅ Phase transitions correctly after all questions answered

### Langfuse Tracking Confirms:
1. **Interrupt Flow**: Energy level → Concerns → Ready questions asked sequentially
2. **Resume Values**: Each answer properly cached and used
3. **No Nested Streams**: Single execution context maintained
4. **Successful Completion**: All 3 interrupts handled, agent continues to next phase

## Key Insights

1. **LangGraph Behavior**: When resuming with `Command(resume=value)`, the entire node re-executes from the beginning, with cached values for previous interrupts

2. **invoke() vs stream()**: Using `invoke()` for resume operations returns complete state without creating nested streaming contexts

3. **Sequential Interrupts**: Work correctly when each resume is handled atomically without re-entering the streaming loop

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Automated test
echo -e "7\nNo concerns\nYes ready\n" > /tmp/test.txt
docker compose run --rm -i gtd-coach python3 test_interrupt_fix.py < /tmp/test.txt

# Verify with Langfuse
python3 verify_langfuse_tracking.py
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED** - Sequential interrupts now work correctly without infinite loops
