# GTD Coach - Quick Start Guide

## Ultra-Simple Workflow (Phases 2-5 Complete)

### Daily: Inbox Processing (2 minutes)
```bash
python3 -m gtd_coach.commands.daily_clarify
```
- ONE decision per item: Keep or Delete
- Automatic deep work detection
- Max 2 deep work blocks per day
- Achieves inbox zero

### Weekly: Manual Timing Setup (2 minutes, once)
1. Open Timing app
2. Create these 3 projects:
   - **Deep Work - Week 34** (Green, High productivity)
   - **Admin & Communication** (Orange, Neutral)
   - **Reactive & Urgent** (Red, Low)
3. Drag activities to assign them

### Weekly: Reality Check
During weekly review, you'll see:
- Actual deep work % vs admin %
- Context switching score
- "Did you work on stated priorities?"
- Simple experiment suggestion

## Philosophy
- **Minimal decisions** - Binary keep/delete
- **No complex hierarchies** - Just 3 Timing projects
- **Reality over intentions** - Track what actually happens
- **ADHD-optimized** - Respects cognitive limits

## Current Status
✅ Daily clarify workflow - Working  
✅ Timing project guidance - Manual setup required  
✅ Weekly reality check - Works with manual projects  
⚠️ Timing API - Read-only (can't create projects via API)

## Next Steps
1. Create the 3 Timing projects manually
2. Run daily clarify to process inbox
3. Weekly review shows reality automatically
