## What Was Set Up

   - Loaded with identifier: "gtd-coach"
   - Running on LM Studio server at localhost:1234
   - Optimized for M3 Pro with 36GB RAM

2. **Directory Structure**: `~/gtd-coach/`
   - Scripts, prompts, data storage, and logs

   - Graphiti memory for behavioral insights
   - Simple command-line interface

## Quick Start

```bash

python3 ~/gtd-coach/gtd-review.py
```

## Test Commands

```bash
# Test timer (1 minute)
~/gtd-coach/scripts/timer.sh 1 "Test complete!"

# Test LLM connectivity
python3 ~/gtd-coach/test-simple-prompt.py

# Test Timing integration (Docker)
./docker-run.sh timing

# Run non-interactive demo
python3 ~/gtd-coach/demo-review.py
```

## Integration Status (Verified August 9, 2025)

âœ… **Timing App Integration**: Successfully tested
   - Fetches real project data (6 projects)
   - Correct time calculations (e.g., 10.9h, 8.6h)
   - 30-minute filtering works as expected
   - API response <1 second

âœ… **Docker/OrbStack**: Fully operational
   - All Python scripts run correctly
   - Data persistence verified
   - Network connectivity to LM Studio confirmed

âœ… **End-to-End Flow**: Complete review tested
   - All 5 phases execute within time limits
   - Data files created with proper structure
   - Graceful error handling implemented

## Review Phases

Your 30-minute review follows this structure:
1. **STARTUP** (2 min) - Welcome and setup
2. **MIND SWEEP** (10 min) - Brain dump everything
3. **PROJECT REVIEW** (12 min) - Quick next actions
4. **PRIORITIZATION** (5 min) - ABC priorities
5. **WRAP-UP** (3 min) - Save and celebrate

## Known Issues

- Large system prompts may timeout - using simplified prompt by default
- Requires interactive terminal for full review
- See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. **Schedule Reviews**: Same time each week works best for ADHD
2. **Customize Prompts**: Edit files in `~/gtd-coach/prompts/`
3. **Review Logs**: Check `~/gtd-coach/logs/` for patterns
4. **Future Integration**: 
   - Timing app data import (manual for now)
   - Graphiti memory for long-term patterns

## Tips for Success

- Put phone in another room during reviews
- Stand up or walk during mind sweep
- Trust the timer - it's your external brain
- Celebrate showing up, not perfection!

Remember: A messy completed review beats a perfect abandoned one!
